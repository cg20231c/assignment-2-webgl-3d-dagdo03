## Objective
Create an interactive 3D scene with WebGL that showcases a personalized letter standing on an XZ plane, combined with lighting techniques from a designated light source.

## Approach & Steps
Document the strategy and step-by-step approach you took to achieve the objectives of the assignment:
1. First i need to know how to create the object using vertices and indices to create the plane and the letter
2. Then i need to know about translating and rotating the object
3. Last one i need to understand about pointing light

### 1. Initialization & Basics
- Briefly describe how you initialized WebGL and any basic setup.
- Mention any issues or challenges faced.

### 2. Plane Construction
- Detail your approach to creating the XZ plane, including choosing dimensions and positioning.
- Include any challenges or deviations from the initial plan.

### 3. 3D Letter Construction
- Explain how you designed the 3D letter, from design considerations to the actual coding.
- Highlight any special techniques or challenges.

### 4. Moving the letter
- Use the eventkey function so i can move the letter

## Challenges & Learnings
I face some challenges but i learn on it. i have error when i create the plane when i create it use y = 0 but i know the problem because my camera position

## References & Resources
List all the external resources, references, tutorials, or documentation you've consulted during the assignment:
- [WebGL Fundamentals](https://webglfundamentals.org/)
- [StackOverflow Post on Matrix Transformations](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/example)
- ChatGPT

## Feedback & Future Work
The task is hard but i think the task is good for the students because i learn a lot about webgl and it makes me understand webgl well. And the deadline is good too, it's not too short for us which have a lot of tasks and final projects

## Screenshots, Screencast & GIFs
Include some visual representation of your work. These can be static images, YouTube videos, or GIFs that demonstrate the functionality and features you implemented.

## Contribution & Collaboration
Rafi SUtrisno, Apta rasendra, and Dafarel Fatih help me a lot in this task because sometimes when i got and error like why my plane or letter doesnt appear they told me about the concept why i got that and then finally i can continue and finished my task.
